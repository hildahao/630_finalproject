        In this project, we found the absence of women in Wikipedia's list. We tried to 
        analyze it from various perspectives, including history, social background, 
        occupation, and Wikipedia readership characteristics, to provide acceptable 
        explanations and insights into women's presence and absence. But again, the 
        source of the data for this project is the pageviews of English Wikipedia. 
        <strong> This data is inherently biased: it represents the reading tendencies of English-speaking 
        readers and may carry a more male perspective.</strong>

        It is hard to imagine that more than 100 years ago, I, as a woman, was not even qualified to walk into a university and stand alongside men on an equal footing for higher education. Gender equality is a topic that is always evolving. It has been a tortuous process, and it may even be regressive. But I believe that with the persistence of generations of feminists, its future will be bright.

        People in this photo are female scholars from Asia 100 years ago. 
        When gazing at them, I could feel the courage and determination that 
        had crossed time and space.
