# The 2nd draft of Final Project


## A brief description of this project
Our project aims to explore the women in the Wikipedia pantheon. We want to know who they are and why they are on the list. According to these questions, we generated our first question:<br/>
**Q1: Who are in the pantheon of Wikipedia?** <br/>
<br/>
To answer this question, we explored the top 200 memorable people on the list. And the result showed that there are *only 2 females* on the list. This data surprised us and made us think, Why did this happen? Why are there only a few women on this list? 

To answer this question, we generated 3 more questions: 
**Q2: What historical reasons impacted women? **
**Q3: How do societies affect women?**
**Q4: What are/were their occupations?**

Except for these questions, we will also study the influence of Wikipedia's readers and contributors. We want to acquire some interesting insights from these questions and diagrams. And we hope the data and insights can be inspiring and help people with future designs.

## What is new in this version
In this version, you can see:<br/>
1. A web page(I really love its style);<br/>
2. A bar chart using the example from chart.js library;<br/>
3. We will add 2 more charts using the D3 library later;<br/>

## What I did
1. Design the webpage with Figma. Check it [here](https://www.figma.com/file/vx8p2yPTd8wEGsC64z125G/INST-630%3A-Pantheon?node-id=0%3A1&t=f8syhoggwYfLJdj1-1)
2. Finished the css code of the web page
3. Finished one bar chart and imported it into the react framework
<br/>
I tried to upload the project into [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/sunny-royal-elm), but when I want to review it, it just kept "Startingâ€¦". Therefore, I record the [recording](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11NUE_PQy0CUXOFr4ct6jBkMkRk1tDKqX?usp=share_link) of the project. Welcome to check!

## Other
I love the background picture, it comes from "https://philippines.michiganintheworld.history.lsa.umich.edu/s/exhibit/page/the-barbour-scholarship". People  in this photo are female scholars from Asia 100 years ago. As I gazed at them, I could feel the courage and determination that had crossed time and space.
